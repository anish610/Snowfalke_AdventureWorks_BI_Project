# Snowfalke_AdventureWorks_BI_Project
I worked on a Snowflake + Power BI project with my friend Ganesh Kangude.

Our purpose was to learn and explore snowflake tool, and we chose Snowflake using its trail period subscription.



For our project, we used Adventure Works dataset and loaded it in S3 Bucket. In Snowflake, we performed ETL processing and utilized SQL for various transformations. We addressed null values by replacing them with appropriate values in the Customer table's address line and occupation columns. Additionally, we identified and removed duplicate rows in the Calendar table.



During the data transformation phase, we created new columns, such as deriving age from birth date and creating age grouping bins for customer age. We also performed table joins between the Product, DimProductSubcategory, and Product Category tables.



To streamline the process, we created staging and final tables, as well as different stored procedure to execute the SQL scripts.



In Power BI, I designed three tabs: Sales, Customer Demographics and Product. My focus was primarily on enhancing the report design and practice different report themes. I learned the significance of color usage, the importance of alignment, and how to make the dashboard more visually appealing and user-friendly.

Also explored the new KPI visual in Power BI.
